#      EMOTIONAL PROSODY PROJECT       #
#    MAKE ACOUSTIC MEASURES TABLE 2    #
# ------------------------------------ #

## What's new in this script?
# 1) measuring based on utterances or vowels, depending on the measure
# 2) using female or male parameters for applicable measures

## This script will get...(per vowel, if not specified)
	# f0
		# f0 mean
		# f0 min (per vowel and per sentence)
		# f0 max (per vowel and per sentence)
		# f0 range
		# f0 SD
	# Intensity (means and SDs only useful for analysis with perception results bc I didn't control distance to mic)		
		# Int mean
		# Int SD
		# 1-to-3 kHz intensity (LTAS) (as a proxy of intensity)
	# Duration
		# duration (entire sound length)
	# Speech Rate
		# speech rate (duration/18 mora)
	# Voice quality
		# H1* (the lower the creakier)
		# H1*-H2* (same as above) (should be nonsig according to; Utsugi, Wang and Ota,ICPhS 2019)
		# H1-A3 (expect Sig according to: Utsugi, Wang and Ota,ICPhS 2019)
		# spectral tilt 
			# H1-3000Hz
			# up to 10kHz (Erickson, et al. 2020)			
		# HNR (irregular F0 creak type)
		# Alpha Ratio 
		# Hammarberg index
		# jitter (expecting nonsig; Utsugi, Wang and Ota,ICPhS 2019)
		# Shimmer (expecting nonsig; Utsugi, Wang and Ota,ICPhS 2019)
		# A1-P0 (nasality; A1 = amplitude of the harmonic under F1. P0 = the amplitude of a low-frequency nasal peak (~250 Hz) (Chen 1997)
		# F1, F2, F3, F4 at midpoint (Erickson et al. 2008; lowered F2, F3, F4 are cues for perception of emotional (sad) speech (/i/-vowel syllable);  filter-related voice quality changes are important for perception of (intense) sadness, whereas source-related voice quality changes, for perception of happiness.)
		# bandwidths of those formants
## will get not in Praat (prob want to use ProsodyPro or Voicesauce)...
	# f0 contour pattern (Yanushevskaya, I., Gobl, C., & Ní Chasaide, A. (2018))
	# try all with STRAIGHT (legacy ver available on Github. to use the recent one, email Kawahara sensei at Wakayama Uni)
